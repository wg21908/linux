# Linux Kernel Development

## What I Prepared for Development and Testing

- See README at https://github.com/secralinux/secralinux/tree/main/blfs/config/linux-kernel-development  
- See .vscode directory at above URL and its contents.  

## What is Recommended on Official Pages

- https://kernelnewbies.org/FirstKernelPatch
  - Vim configuration
  - Vim as default editor
  - Had to install libesmtp and esmtp via scripts at blfs/other/, main config file is at /home/secra/.esmtprc.  Also had to create a Google App password to make this work.  While signed in to wg21908@gmail.com Gmail account, go to other browser tab and search "Google App Passwords" to get to page to manage this part.
  - Using mutt, mutt was configured against esmtp but I reconfigured it to use sendmail
