|:---------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| arch/          | Contains architecture‑specific code (for each CPU family: x86, ARM, RISC‑V, etc.), including low‑level boot, platform setup and CPU support. |
| block/         | Implements the generic block layer (block devices, I/O scheduling, request queueing) shared across many drivers.                             |
| certs/         | Holds certificate and key infrastructure used for kernel module signature verification and secure boot/chain‑of‑trust.                       |
| chromeos/      | ChromeOS‑specific support and code (for devices running ChromeOS) integrated into mainline.                                                  |
| crypto/        | Provides cryptographic algorithm implementations and their kernel infrastructure (hashing, encryption, codecs).                              |
| Documentation/ | Contains documentation (text files, subsystem descriptions, developer guidelines) for the kernel subsystems.                                 |
| drivers/       | The vast collection of hardware driver code (graphics, USB, network, storage, sound, etc), organized by device type.                         |
| firmware/      | Some small user‑space like code, firmware blobs or support for loading firmware, and related tooling.                                        |
| fs/            | Filesystem implementations and VFS (virtual filesystem) glue: ext4, XFS, Btrfs, F2FS, etc.                                                   |
| include/       | Public header files exported to various parts of the kernel (common interfaces, structures, macros) and architecture headers.                |
| init/          | Early boot‑up / initialization code executed before the full kernel services are running (setup memory, prepare subsystems).                 |
| ipc/           | Infrastructure for inter‑process communication: message queues, shared memory, semaphores, etc.                                              |
| kernel/        | Core kernel functionality: scheduling, signals, timers, kthreads, generic kernel services.                                                   |
| lib/           | Utility library code used by many parts of the kernel: common functions, helpers not tied to one subsystem.                                  |
| mm/            | Memory‑management subsystem: virtual memory, paging, allocation, memory zones, swap support.                                                 |
| net/           | Networking stack: sockets, protocols (TCP/IP, etc), network device support, packet handling, netlink.                                        |
| privileged/    | (If present) – code for privileged execution environments or helpers for trusted execution (less common).                                    |
| samples/       | Sample drivers or modules illustrating usage—useful for developers to see how to use kernel APIs.                                            |
| scripts/       | Build and configuration helper scripts used by the kernel build system (Kconfig, Makefiles, module helpers).                                 |
| security/      | Security subsystems and frameworks: SELinux, AppArmor, LSMs, security keys, capability handling.                                             |
| sound/         | Audio subsystem: sound card drivers, ALSA support, mixer infrastructure.                                                                     |
| tools/         | Auxiliary tools and utilities: performance tracing, debugging, analysis tools that may sit outside the core kernel build.                    |
| usr/           | Support for “/usr”‑install infrastructures, user‑mode helpers, or code to handle installations where `/usr` is separate (relatively newer).  |
| virt/          | Virtualization support: hypervisor interfaces, KVM, paravirtualization, guest and host code.                                                 |
